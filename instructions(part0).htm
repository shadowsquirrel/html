                        Welcom to our experiment!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In this experiment, you will be playing a game that consists of 6 stages where you will be randomly assigned to
                        a group and to the role <strong>leader</strong> or <strong>follower</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You will be playing the same game <strong>10 times</strong> and every time you will be <strong>re</strong>-assigned to a new group and a new role.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The entire experiment will last about 75 minutes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        First, you will be introduced to the stages of the game, then you will be introduced to the mechanics of the game.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once you are done with these introduction, you will have a short quiz testing your understanding of the game. If you fail to answer any of the questions correctly, you will not be qualified to play the experiment.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After the quiz, you will practice the game against computer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once you are done with these stages, you will begin the experiment. The experiment will last for 50 minutes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You will start every period of the game with 1000 tokens. 1 token is worth half a penny.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After every period, your net payoff will be calculated.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At the end of the experiment, you will be paid x USD for your participation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition, one of your net payoffs from the 10 periods you have played will be randomly selected and be paid.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You have the possibility to make a maximum of 2000 tokens from any period of the game depending on your role and the other players you will be playing against.
                    </p>
